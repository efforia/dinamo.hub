EOS
==========

EOS is an operating system based on GNU/Linux. The base software was made
originally with Arch Linux ARM for Raspberry Pi, but it could be used for any
other platform. Modified with custom packages and some bash scripting. This is 
the EOS tree repository for building new containers, machines or images.
